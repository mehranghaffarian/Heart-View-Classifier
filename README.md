## Introduction

Echocardiography is a key imaging modality for diagnosing and managing heart diseases. Accurately identifying the view type (e.g., apical, parasternal) in echocardiographic images is critical for downstream clinical tasks. This project applies deep learning to automate this classification, reducing the dependency on manual annotations and increasing diagnostic efficiency.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project comprises labeled echocardiographic images obtained from publicly available sources or through collaboration with medical institutions. The images represent various standard views, such as:

- **Apical four-chamber (A4C)**
- **Parasternal long-axis (PLAX)**
- **Parasternal short-axis (PSAX)**
- **Subcostal (SC)**
- **Other specialized views**

## Methodology

The model architecture is based on ResNet, VGG, or custom CNN, which is fine-tuned on the echocardiographic dataset. Key steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to enhance generalization.
2. **Model Training:** The neural network is trained using proper optimization method with loss function.
3. **Evaluation:** The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
